# Alt-Investment

## Roadmap

1. Weâ€™ll list companies NFT on the marketplace. 
2. Users can come and buy those NFTs.
3. The company will also have their login.
4. Whenever a company thinks they need investment for a particular feature, they can put the description of the idea, put enough evidence and now that all will be encrypted in NFT.
5. Users can buy those NFTs, NFT will also act as a contract between the User and a Company that the company is taking the particular investment via NFT from the User for building the particular feature.
6. For example, if Tesla says they want to create an S9 model and for the prototype research they need XYZ investment.
7. Tesla will come to the AltInvesment platform:
    1. Add Title
    2. Add a description - plan
    3. Add no of NFTs to be minted
8. If the Tesla S9 model succeeds, those NFTs' prices will soar.
9. Once the price soars, users can sell NFTs to book their profit.
